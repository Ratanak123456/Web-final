They also visit the graves of their ancestors and offer foods like rice, fruit, and meat to show thanks. Traditional Korean foods are an important part of the holiday. One of the most popular is a half-moon-shaped rice cake called songpyeon. The sweet treat is filled with sesame seeds, red beans, or honey."
